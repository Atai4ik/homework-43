    <div class="myDiv">

        <p> <span style="font-weight: 500;">Elon Musk thinks and acts on a larger, more cosmic scale than we’re accustomed to from entrepreneurs. Musk has become a household name synonymous with the future.
            Whether he’s working on electric vehicles <i>(<a class="tesla_link" href="https://www.tesla.com/"
                    target="_blank">Tesla</a>)</i> or sending rockets into space <i>(<a class="spacex_link"
                            href="https://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank">SpaceX</a>)</i>, his larger-than-life
                    reputation attracts its
            fair share of attention — and scrutiny. His main projects take on almost every major industry and global
            problem conceivable, and imagine a disruptive fundamental rewiring of that space or sector.

            <h2><i>SpaceX</i></h2>
            <p>In 2002, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, with the goal of making
                humanity multiplanetary.</p>
            <p>“You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great — and that’s what being a
                spacefaring civilization is all about,” per a Musk quote on the SpaceX website. “It’s about believing in
                the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more
            <p>exciting than going out there and being among the stars.”</p>
            In the summer of 2020, SpaceX became the first commercial company to send 2 NASA astronauts to the
            International Space Station and back. The mission also marked the first manned launch from US soil since
            2011, when NASA ended its space shuttle program.</p>

            <h2><i>Tesla</i></h2>
            <p> <b>Tesla, Inc.</b> is an American electric vehicle and clean energy
                company based in Austin, Texas, United States. Tesla designs and manufactures electric cars, battery
                energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and
                services. Tesla is one of the world's most valuable companies and remains the most valuable automaker in
                the world with a market cap of nearly $1 trillion. The company had the most sales of battery electric
                vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 16% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in
                hybrids) and 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy,
                the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy
                is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3 gigawatt-hours
                (GWh) installed in 2020.</p>
            <p>Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a
                tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a US$6.5 million
                investment, X.com co-founder Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company and its chairman.
                He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to
                sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began
                production of its first car model, the Roadster, in 2009. This was followed by the Tesla Model S sedan
                in 2012, the Tesla Model X SUV in 2015, the Tesla Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Tesla Model Y crossover
                in 2020. The Tesla Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June
                2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[8] Tesla's global vehicle sales
                were 499,550 units in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the previous year. In October 2021, Tesla's market
                capitalization reached US$1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history.</p>
                In the summer of 2020, SpaceX became the first commercial company to send 2 NASA astronauts to the
                International Space Station and back. The mission also marked the first manned launch from US soil since
                2011, when NASA ended its space shuttle program.</p>

            <h2><i>Boring Company</i></h2>
            <p> <b>The Boring Company (TBC)</b> is an American infrastructure and tunnel construction
                services company founded by Elon Musk. Its current and proposed projects are designed for intra-city
                ("loop") transit systems.</p>
            <p>TBC has completed two tunnels in Las Vegas for loop travel. It has also completed one tunnel for testing
                Hyperloop and loop travel in Los Angeles County. Other tunnels are in various stages of discussion and
                planning.</p>
            <p>Musk cited difficulty with Los Angeles traffic and what he sees as limitations with the current
                two-dimensional transportation network as his early inspiration for the project.[4][7] The Boring
                Company was initially formed as a subsidiary of SpaceX, becoming a separate and fully independent
                company in 2018. As of December 2018, 90% of the equity was owned by Musk,[8] with 6% held by SpaceX in
                return for the use of SpaceX resources during the initial startup of the company.[9] Outside investments
                during 2019 have changed the equity split.</p>

            <p> <b>OpenAI Inc.</b> The company, considered a competitor to DeepMind, conducts
                research in the field of AI with the stated goal of promoting and developing friendly AI in a way that
                benefits humanity as a whole. The organization was founded in San Francisco in late 2015 by Elon Musk,
                Sam Altman, and others, who collectively pledged US$1 billion. Musk resigned from the board in February
                2018 but remained a donor. In 2019, OpenAI LP received a US$1 billion investment from Microsoft.</p>

            <p> <b>Neuralink Corporation</b> is a neurotechnology company developing implantable
                brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) and founded by Elon Musk and others. The company's headquarters is in
                the Pioneer Building in San Francisco sharing offices with OpenAI.[6] Neuralink was launched in 2016 and
                was first publicly reported in March 2017.[1][2]</p>
            <p>Since its founding, the company has hired several high-profile neuroscientists from various
                universities.[7] By July 2019, it had received $158 million in funding (of which $100 million was from
                Musk) and was employing a staff of 90 employees.[8] At that time, Neuralink announced that it was
                working on a "sewing machine-like" device capable of implanting very thin (4 to 6 μm in width[9])
                threads into the brain, and demonstrated a system that read information from a lab rat via 1,500
                electrodes. They had anticipated starting experiments with humans in 2020;[8] but have since moved that
                projection to 2021.[10]</p>
            <p>Several neuroscientists and publications, including the MIT Technology Review, have criticized claims
                made by Musk in relation to the technology.[11][12]</p>
